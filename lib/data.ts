They're prices are great! Friendly staff.\n\nHell, they'll even help you empty your trunk so you can put your spare tire away! They always go above and beyond when they really don't have to. I've never met a shop that went so above and beyond like this place does.\n\nNow I live about 30 minutes away and I still come here. Even when I lived an hour and a half away, this was still my go to place. The drive doesn't matter because the service they provide is absolutely worth it! They always have what I need.

He explained that the sidewall of the tire was bad and that we'd need to replace the whole tire. The back tires needed replacing anyway, so he replaced the back two tires and valve stems all in about 30 minutes. We were blown away at the price and ease of service.
