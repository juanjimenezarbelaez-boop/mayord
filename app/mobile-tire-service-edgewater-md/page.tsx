    question: "Do you come to my location to change a tire?",
    answer:
      "Yes. That's exactly what our mobile tire service is — we come to your home, work, or wherever you're safely pulled over and change or replace the tire on the spot. Just call us with your location and tire size and we'll head your way during shop hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far do you travel for mobile tire service?",
    answer:
      "We cover roughly a 15-minute drive — about 10 miles — from our shop at 175 Mayo Rd in Edgewater. That includes Edgewater, Annapolis, Riva, Mayo, Davidsonville and the surrounding communities. A little farther out? Call and we'll confirm we can reach you in about a minute.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does mobile tire service cost?",
    answer:
      "Mobile service starts with a service-call fee that's applied to the cost of your service, plus the price of the repair or tire itself. Pricing depends on your tire size and what the job needs, so we confirm the number with you by phone before we dispatch — no surprises when we arrive.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can you get to me?",
    answer:
      "It depends on where you are and how busy the shop is that day, but nearby areas like Riva and Mayo are typically only a few minutes out. We'll give you an honest arrival estimate when you call — we won't promise a time we can't keep.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you bring a used tire in my size to my location?",
    answer:
      "Usually, yes. Tell us your tire size (it's printed on the sidewall, like 205/55R16) and we'll check our used and new stock before we leave, so we can bring the right tire with us whenever it's available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer mobile tire service in Annapolis?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Annapolis is one of our most common mobile-service areas — Forest Drive, Bay Ridge, West Street and the US-50 corridor are all a short drive across the South River from our shop. See our Annapolis mobile tire service page for details.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my tire can't be repaired on site?",
    answer:
      "If a tire can't be safely repaired, we can install your spare or replace it with a used or new tire in your size right there. And if the problem is bigger than the tire — a damaged wheel or unsafe location — we'll tell you honestly and recommend a tow instead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer mobile service on Sundays?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We dispatch mobile service during shop hours seven days a week, including Sunday (9am–4pm). Call us and if we're open, we'll do our best to get to you.",

                <p>
                  Mobile tire service means we come to your vehicle instead of you
                  coming to us. Rather than risking a drive on a flat — or paying to tow
                  a car that just needs a tire — you call, tell us where you are, and we
                  bring the fix to your driveway, your workplace parking lot, or wherever
                  you&apos;re safely pulled over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It&apos;s the right call when a tire is fully flat, blown, or shredded
                  and you can&apos;t safely drive to the shop. If your car is still safe
                  to drive slowly, the fastest and cheapest option is usually to bring it
                  straight to us at 175 Mayo Rd, where we have our full tire inventory on
                  hand. When in doubt, call and we&apos;ll help you decide honestly.

                  tire before we leave. On location we can typically:

                <p>
                  Mobile service starts with a service-call fee that covers coming to
                  your location — and that fee is applied to the cost of your service, so
                  you&apos;re not paying twice. On top of that you pay for whatever the
                  job actually needs: a flat repair, a spare install, or a used or new
                  tire in your size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because the total depends on your specific tire and situation, we
                  confirm the price with you by phone before we dispatch. You approve the
                  number first — no surprise charges when we show up. It&apos;s the same
                  honest, no-nonsense pricing our neighbors know us for.

                  We dispatch mobile service during shop hours, seven days a week:
                  Monday through Saturday from 8am (until 6:30pm most days, 6pm Thursday)
                  and Sunday from 9am to 4pm. Mobile calls are handled alongside the work
                  in the shop, so arrival times vary with how busy we are that day.

                <p>
                  We won&apos;t promise a guaranteed response time we can&apos;t keep.
                  What we will do is give you an honest arrival estimate when you call —
                  and nearby areas like Riva and Mayo are typically only a few minutes
                  out. Call {siteConfig.phone} and we&apos;ll tell you straight.

                  Mobile tire service isn&apos;t always the right answer, and we&apos;ll
                  say so. If your vehicle is stopped in a live traffic lane, on a narrow
                  bridge, or anywhere it isn&apos;t safe for us to work, you need a tow or
                  police assistance first — not a tire tech. The same goes if the damage
                  goes beyond the tire, like a bent wheel or suspension damage that
                  can&apos;t be fixed on the roadside.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We&apos;d rather lose a call than send you bad advice. If a tow is the
                  safer, smarter move, we&apos;ll tell you honestly and point you in the
                  right direction. That&apos;s how we&apos;ve earned our neighbors&apos;
                  trust — and it&apos;s not going to change.
